    at inference time. The process involves a Hybrid Router that determines the optimal
    format for structuring information, improving knowledge-intensive tasks. It incorporates
    components like StructRAGGraph, StructRAGCatalogue, StructRAGAlgorithm, and StructRAGTable
    to manage and execute tasks efficiently. An example script demonstrates scoring
    tasks by complexity, utilizing models such as Model.GEMMA2_9B_FP16. This innovative
    approach enhances machine learning processes, allowing for more effective decision-making
    and information management through structured reasoning and knowledge restructuring.
    Keywords include StructRAG, hybrid information structuring, language models, and
    knowledge-intensive reasoning.

  summary: 'This guide provides a comprehensive overview for installing and setting
    up the Dria SDK, which is used for synthetic data generation in the Dria Network.
    It highlights the system requirements, specifically compatibility with Python
    3.10 or higher, and includes step-by-step instructions for creating a conda environment
    and installing the SDK. Key points include obtaining an RPC token from the Dria
    Login API to access the network, managing it via environment variables or a `.env`
    file, and addressing common installation issues, especially with the coincurve
    library. The Dria Network is currently in its alpha stage, with controlled access
    through RPCs, and there is no cost for generating data at this time. Additionally,
    users can contribute by running a node to help scale the network. For troubleshooting,
    the guide recommends installing necessary tools and offers support via Discord.
