  summary: The Dria network utilizes tasks as fundamental units of work executed asynchronously
    by nodes, providing scalability and efficiency. These tasks consist of workflows
    and models, which are published to the network for execution by available compute
    nodes. Key features include model selection, asynchronous execution, and result
    retrieval. Users can create and send tasks using built-in modules, such as the
    Simple task, for prompt execution on specific models. The lifecycle of a task
    involves creation, publication, execution, result retrieval, and completion, ensuring
    an effective distribution of work. Keywords include Dria network, asynchronous
    tasks, software development, task execution, and models.
how-to/workflows.md:
  hash: e4dd6ac6ef5631c3715bf6bfbbd7de49
  summary: 'The article provides a comprehensive guide on creating custom workflows
    within the Dria Network using the `dria_workflows` Python package. It details
    how workflows break down complex tasks into manageable steps by interacting with
    Large Language Models (LLMs) and I/O memory. Key components include setting configuration
    parameters like maximum steps and time limits, defining generative and search
    steps, and using memory operations for data transfer between steps. Additionally,
    it covers the flow, which determines task execution order and conditional logic.
    The article further explains memory operations, inputs, outputs, and steps through
    code examples, illustrating how to construct effective task management solutions
    with LLMs on the Dria platform. Keywords: Dria Network, workflows, LLM, Python,
    task management, customization.'

  summary: 'StructRAG is a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed
    to enhance large language models (LLMs) for complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning
    tasks. By employing cognitive-inspired techniques, StructRAG addresses the challenge
    of processing scattered and noisy information, reformatting original documents
    into optimal structures for improved inference. This results in state-of-the-art
    accuracy and reasoning capabilities across various knowledge-based tasks. Key
    components include StructRAGSynthesize for structuring workflows, StructRAGSimulate
    for generating and testing solutions, and StructRAGJudge for evaluating and refining
    outputs. The framework significantly improves LLM performance by systematically
    restructuring and evaluating data. Keywords: StructRAG, Retrieval-Augmented Generation,
    Large Language Models, Knowledge-Intensive Reasoning, Artificial Intelligence,
    Cognitive Techniques.'

  summary: 'The article explores StructRAG, a technique for efficient knowledge restructuring
    in large language models (LLMs), enhancing their reasoning abilities through hybrid
    information structuring. Key terms include StructRAG, Knowledge Restructuring,
    and Hybrid Information. The approach utilizes a Hybrid Router to decide the format
    for structured information, improving the reasoning of AI models during inference.
    The article also provides a Python code example demonstrating the use of StructRAG
    with the Dria library to evaluate task complexity. For further details, the paper
    "StructRAG: Boosting Knowledge Intensive Reasoning of LLMs via Inference-time
    Hybrid Information Structurization" is referenced.'
