# Dria

Dria is a __complete__ synthetic data infrastructure, featuring:

- A framework for creating, managing, and orchestrating synthetic data pipelines.
- A multi-agent network that can synthesize data from web and siloed sources.

- **Note**: Network capacity and data generation volumes are limited during the current phase of Dria.

### Why use Dria?

Dria is designed to empower a wide range of AI projects, from traditional predictive models to advanced generative and large language model (LLM) applications. 
Whether you’re working on classification, extraction, instruction following, dialogue generation, or complex reasoning tasks, Dria provides the scalable and versatile tools you need to accelerate your AI development with high-quality, diverse synthetic datasets.

**Massive Parallelization and Compute Offloading**: 

As a network, Dria allows you to directly offload your compute needs to the network, leveraging massive parallelization. This means faster processing and more efficient resource utilization without the need for personal GPU infrastructure.


**Flexible and Scalable Custom Pipelines**: 

Dria provides flexible tools to write custom pipelines and scale them through the network. You can design complex data generation workflows tailored to your specific needs, all without requiring your own GPUs.


**Extensive Built-in Toolset**: 

Dria comes with a extensive factory of built-in tools derived from verified research papers, significantly speed up the data generation process.


**Searching for Grounding**: 

Dria enables you to create pipelines in which the AI can search for grounding in the web or siloed APIs, allowing you to create diverse synthetic data with real-life distribution.


#### Decentralization

_Dria’s primary objective is to leverage decentralization to obtain state-of-the-art synthesized data._

**What does leveraging decentralization mean?**

Creating value for AI that can be obtained through decentralization.

- Unbounded access to web based grounding
- Hyper parallelization of inference
- Ensembling outputs from diverse models
- Ability to include human diversity
- Creating economic value
