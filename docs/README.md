# Dria

Dria is the only synthetic data infrastructure that you can balance data quality, diversity, and complexity all together in a single interface.

- A framework for creating, managing, and orchestrating synthetic data pipelines.
- A multi-agent network that can synthesize data from web and siloed sources.

### Why use Dria?

Dria provides the scalable and versatile tools you need to accelerate your AI development with high-quality, diverse synthetic datasets.

**Massive Parallelization and Compute Offloading**: 

As a network, Dria allows you to directly offload your compute needs to the network, leveraging massive parallelization. This means faster processing and more efficient resource utilization without the need for personal GPU infrastructure.


**Flexible and Scalable Custom Pipelines**: 

Dria provides flexible tools to write custom pipelines and scale them through the network. You can design complex data generation workflows tailored to your specific needs, all without requiring your own GPUs.


**Extensive Built-in Toolset**: 

Dria comes with a extensive factory of built-in tools derived from verified research papers, significantly speed up the data generation process.


**Searching for Grounding**: 

Dria enables you to create pipelines in which the AI can search for grounding in the web or siloed APIs, allowing you to create diverse synthetic data with real-life distribution.
