# ListExtender

## Overview
ListExtender is a singleton class that extends a given list of items by generating additional related items. It takes an initial list as input and returns an extended version of that list while maintaining uniqueness of items.

## Inputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| e_list | List[str] | Initial list of items to be extended |

## Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| extended_list | List[str] | Combined list of original and newly generated items |
| model | str | The AI model used for generation |

#### Usage

ListExtender instance can be used in data generation as follows:

```python
from dria.factory import ListExtender

my_dataset = DriaDataset(
    name="list_extender",
    description="A dataset for list extension",
    schema=ListExtender.OutputSchema,
)
generator = DatasetGenerator(dataset=my_dataset)
```

Expected output:

```json
